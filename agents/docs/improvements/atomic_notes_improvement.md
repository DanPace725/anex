hurm the atomic ideas are still meh. Need to setup a prompt such that it has a tendency to make fewer notes overall
That is typically the prompt it makes like 3 notes for one idea sometimes

have you tried messing with the min max / custom prompt stuff to see if changes anything?

like maybe set it to 1 and 3 ?

Yeah so I migrated the min to 1 and the max to like 10 i will move the max down to like 5 and see how it works then maybe
kk will do that, i have a few more to get through on this note

I think there's an element of lossy compression with this approach. On the one hand, we're asking a model to just "take notes" but on the other we're kinda asking for "synthesize and pull out salient ideas"... I think those are different things
Like it kinda depends on what you consider an atomic note I think

Hurm how coudl we segment those. Is that two plugins i feel like its not though

I'm not sure. I think there's at least 2 interpretations of an atomic note ; just pulling the raw strings out of the larger document and then compressing the "gist" into a few succinct bullet points I think

So an atomic idea shouldn't need supports is kidna how i think of it.
And that means it could be a sentence or a three page paper
CapulusIRL — 3:14 PM
So, a more summarized / synthesized concept that doesn't need the source context to make sense basically
so, not atomic in size, more like, the fundamental ideas and concepts. perhaps?

Yeah let me go find the one that I felt was a good one that has a few simple ideas and a larger one that needed to be compiled from most of the system. And mind me coming back and iedting is fine, its when it takes and splits one idea into three notes
(or worse repeats a single idea three ways in three notes)
