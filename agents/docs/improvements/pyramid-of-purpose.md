The 'pyramid of purpose' framework emphasizes that personal development should serve the mission of honoring God's glory.

The pyramid of purpose is a down flowing pyromaid with the following elements
- God's Glory - the end of man
- Life Domains - zones to ask are you being failthful
    - Intelectional
    - Physical
    - Recreational
    - Relational
    - Vocational
    - Economical
- Goals - Long Term targets
- Projects - medium term
- Tasks/Habbits - regular daily events

The sole goal of this framework is to create a holistic life framework for being a productive Christian [^1]. To then tie that into seeing it clearly how you are glorifying [[God]].
