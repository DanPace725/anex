## 🧩 General Summary
This video challenges the traditional secular self-help narrative by arguing that true productivity and life purpose are found through a Christian worldview focusing on glorifying God. Reagan Rose presents a framework called the "pyramid of purpose," emphasizing that all areas of personal development—spiritual, intellectual, and physical—should ultimately serve a higher mission: honoring God's glory. He underlines the importance of using productivity tools not as ends in themselves but as means to achieve faithful stewardship, integrating personal improvement with divine purpose.

## 🧭 Directed Applications
- **Engineering & Systems Thinking**: Implement systems that prioritize long-term goals aligned with core values and divine purpose, ensuring projects support these overarching aims.
- **Creativity & Storytelling**: Develop narratives and content that reflect purpose-driven growth, drawing on personal faith and experiences as storytelling tools.
- **Faith & Character Formation**: Approach personal growth with the aim of enhancing your ability to contribute to faith communities and society.
- **ADHD/ASD Strategies**: Structure tasks around personal rhythms, using habitual anchors to support executive function and aligning with meaningful objectives.
- **Multipassionate Integration**: Identify common threads among diverse interests to form a cohesive purpose, using faith as a unifying principle.

> 0:00 The world is full of self-help gurus
> 0:03 claiming to have the secret to a happier
> 0:05 life. They say that if we just listen to
> 0:07 them, we can be more successful, more
> 0:10 attractive, make more money, and in all
> 0:12 just be more satisfied with our lives.
> 0:16 But
> 0:18 they are lying to you. Okay, was that a
> 0:21 little dramatic? Was the red light a
> 0:22 little much? Hey, if you are new here,
> 0:24 my name is Reagan Rose. I am the creator
> 0:27 of Redeeming Productivity, which is a
> 0:29 ministry designed to help Christians get
> 0:31 more done for the glory of God. But I
> 0:34 have a little bit of a confession, and
> 0:35 that's that I love self-help books. But
> 0:38 time and again, I found that there is
> 0:40 one big lie behind every message of
> 0:43 worldly self-help, and it's this: you
> 0:47 belong to you. And I want to show how
> 0:50 even Christians can fall for this lie
> 0:52 sometimes and why it is absolutely
> 0:54 critical that we build our concept of
> 0:57 self-help or even personal productivity
> 1:00 on the word of God and not on worldly
> 1:02 wisdom.
> 1:04 One of the things you begin to notice
> 1:06 about self-development and self-help
> 1:09 books the more you read them is that
> 1:11 self-help is inherently religious.
> 1:15 \[Music\]
> 1:17 When you start thinking about self-help,
> 1:20 you have to ask the bigger questions of
> 1:22 life. Why am I here? What's the purpose
> 1:25 of life? And these are all ultimately
> 1:28 religious questions. They speak to our
> 1:30 purpose and what it is we're supposed to
> 1:32 be pursuing.
> 1:34 Look at all those nice eggs.
> 1:37 Good job, girls.
> 1:39 It doesn't take long to notice the
> 1:41 religious overtones in even the most
> 1:43 popular self-development books. This is
> 1:46 why in atomic habits, James Clear can
> 1:49 talk about how our habits are downstream
> 1:52 from our identity. You have Mark Manson
> 1:56 talking about beliefs in a very
> 1:58 utilitarian way and saying, "Change out
> 2:00 your beliefs that aren't helping you get
> 2:02 the life you want for beliefs that will
> 2:04 help you get the life you want." As if
> 2:06 it didn't matter whether the belief was
> 2:07 true or not, just whether it helps you
> 2:09 to get what you want out of life. You
> 2:11 cannot talk about the big questions of
> 2:14 life or even what it means to improve
> 2:17 without having some defined idea about
> 2:20 why I'm here and what I'm supposed to be
> 2:22 doing. Self-help will always get
> 2:23 religious. It can't help itself.
> 2:27 But what is the good life then? That's
> 2:29 the big question. Because behind every
> 2:32 definition of self-help, there's always
> 2:34 this assumption about what constitutes
> 2:38 the good life. What is the purpose of
> 2:40 life? Now, whether stated explicitly or
> 2:44 not, it's always going to be assumed
> 2:46 that the purpose of life is my
> 2:49 happiness. One of the great advantages
> 2:52 Christians have is that we literally
> 2:54 know why we exist. We know the meaning
> 2:57 of life. God has told us in his word
> 2:59 that it's not all about me. In fact,
> 3:02 it's all about him.
> 3:06 We know that the happy life, the blessed
> 3:08 life is the one that has us walking with
> 3:10 the Lord daily, saved by grace through
> 3:13 faith in Jesus Christ, planted like a
> 3:17 tree by streams of water and stewarding
> 3:20 every day of this life for his sake. But
> 3:22 the sad thing, the the tragic thing and
> 3:25 the reason I'm making this is that even
> 3:27 mature believers can fall back into this
> 3:30 way of thinking and assuming it's my
> 3:32 life and that's where I'm going to find
> 3:34 my fulfillment.
> 3:37 So what would a Christian vision of
> 3:39 self-help look like then? Because one
> 3:41 thing that the self-help gurus do get
> 3:43 right is that we should be growing. We
> 3:46 should be seeking to develop ourselves.
> 3:48 It still baffles me that there are so
> 3:50 many Christians who are just content to
> 3:52 stagnate. They don't care about their
> 3:55 spiritual growth. They don't care about
> 3:56 getting in the word. They don't care
> 3:58 about growing themselves, making them a
> 4:01 better tool in the hand of God. It
> 4:04 reminds me a lot of the wicked servant
> 4:07 in the parable of the talents who took
> 4:09 the things that God had entrusted to him
> 4:11 and he just buried them in the ground.
> 4:13 So, let's assume that we want to be good
> 4:15 stewards of these lives, but we want to
> 4:17 do it in the right way. What would that
> 4:20 look like? So, let me show you a
> 4:21 framework that can help us think about
> 4:23 self-development from a more godly
> 4:25 perspective.
> 4:28 This is the pyramid of purpose.
> 4:33 So, we look at this, we're asking the
> 4:34 question, what are we building toward in
> 4:37 our life? And at the top of the pyramid,
> 4:40 the answer to that is God's glory.
> 4:45 God's glory is the chief end of man.
> 4:47 Everything we do should support this
> 4:49 ultimate mission. And so if we work
> 4:51 backwards from that, how would we lead a
> 4:53 God-glorifying life? Well, we might
> 4:55 think about the different domains.
> 4:59 These are the different areas of your
> 5:00 life that God has given you to steward.
> 5:03 One way we talk about this in the
> 5:05 academy is we talk about your spiritual,
> 5:07 intellectual, physical, recreational,
> 5:09 relational, vocational, and economical
> 5:11 domains. That sounds like a lot, but
> 5:13 it's just a way of breaking your life
> 5:15 down into categories so you can ask the
> 5:17 question, am I being a faithful steward
> 5:19 in each of these areas? So once you have
> 5:21 these domains of stewardship articulated
> 5:24 and what faithfulness looks like in each
> 5:26 of them, then we can employ goals.
> 5:31 Goals are simply a way for us to say,
> 5:33 "Hey, I want to improve in this single
> 5:36 area of life. Let me make a plan for how
> 5:38 I'm going to improve my faithfulness in
> 5:40 that area." This would be like an
> 5:42 exercise goal to improve the physical
> 5:44 domain of stewardship. This would be a
> 5:46 spiritual goal like reading through the
> 5:48 New Testament, right? You get the idea.
> 5:51 We're employing the methods of personal
> 5:52 productivity in service of greater
> 5:54 faithfulness to God in each of these
> 5:56 areas, in service of our ultimate
> 5:58 mission to glorify God in all areas of
> 6:00 life. And then we break these goals down
> 6:02 into projects. These are just bundles of
> 6:06 tasks that help us reach the goal. It's
> 6:09 us breaking that goal down into here's
> 6:11 the milestones. Here's the things I'm
> 6:13 going to do. Here's what I'm going to
> 6:14 track to help get me there. And at the
> 6:16 very bottom is just our day-to-day. It's
> 6:18 the tasks I must do. It's the habits
> 6:22 that I'm practicing. These are just the
> 6:25 little things in life like finishing the
> 6:27 paper for school or sending an email or
> 6:30 reading your Bible daily or going to the
> 6:32 gym or whatever those things are. And
> 6:35 the purpose of the pyramid of purpose is
> 6:38 to be able to holistically look at our
> 6:39 life and strategically say, how do all
> 6:43 of these fit together towards my
> 6:45 ultimate objective? Because if you
> 6:47 approach your life this way and you're
> 6:49 strategically setting goals and you're
> 6:51 breaking them into projects and you're
> 6:52 doing tasks and habits that contribute
> 6:54 to that, you should be able to draw an
> 6:56 arrow from any level of your life
> 7:02 such that you can see clearly how all of
> 7:04 this contributes to your ultimate
> 7:06 purpose of glorifying God with your
> 7:08 life. Thomas Watson said that the glory
> 7:11 of God must be a silver thread which
> 7:13 runs through all that we do. And that's
> 7:16 exactly what we're trying to do when we
> 7:17 use this framework of the pyramid of
> 7:19 purpose. It's about self-development,
> 7:21 but it's self-development for a purpose,
> 7:24 the ultimate purpose, God's glory. When
> 7:27 we understand personal productivity and
> 7:29 self-help as just tools that can help us
> 7:33 rather than a philosophy of life or a
> 7:36 religion, then we can put them in their
> 7:39 proper place and let them actually aid
> 7:42 us in pursuing a better, more faithful
> 7:45 stewardship of our life. But this
> 7:47 requires some discernment. So, I can
> 7:50 appreciate that there's a skill to
> 7:52 learning how to set and reach goals. And
> 7:54 I can learn that from even some of these
> 7:56 books. But I have to view it through the
> 7:59 ultimate lens that the goal of all goals
> 8:02 is the glory of God. I can still
> 8:05 schedule my week and do my weekly
> 8:08 reviews, but I do it with an
> 8:09 understanding that what I'm actually
> 8:11 doing is stewarding God's time. It's not
> 8:14 my life. And even as I pursue better
> 8:17 habits, I'm doing it with an
> 8:19 understanding that it is Christ working
> 8:22 in me both to will and to work for his
> 8:24 good pleasure. It's all downstream from
> 8:26 knowing that I belong to him. I don't
> 8:29 belong to me. Self-help and personal
> 8:31 productivity make great tools, but
> 8:34 terrible religions. So, if you're a
> 8:36 Christian who takes seriously God's call
> 8:38 for you to steward your life for his
> 8:41 glory, I would invite you to subscribe
> 8:43 to the channel and follow along as I
> 8:46 seek to help you redeem productivity. ---
